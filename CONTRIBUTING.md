## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow a **GitFlow-inspired** approach:

- `main` — Production-ready code, protected like Fort Knox
- `develop` — Integration branch for features
- `feature/description` — New features and enhancements
- `hotfix/description` — Critical bug fixes
- `docs/description` — Documentation updates

### Development Process

1. **🎯 Choose Your Battle**
   - Browse open issues labeled `good first issue` for newcomers
   - Check `help wanted` for intermediate challenges
   - Propose new features in discussions

2. **🌿 Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature
   ```

3. **⚒️ Forge Your Code**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **🧪 Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run the test suite
   npm test  # or pytest, go test, etc.

   # Check code quality
   npm run lint

   # Ensure builds work
   npm run build
   ```

5. **📝 Commit Your Work**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature

   - Implement core functionality
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Update documentation

   Closes #123"
   ```

### Commit Message Format

We use **Conventional Commits** for clear history:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` — New features
- `fix` — Bug fixes
- `docs` — Documentation changes
- `style` — Code style changes
- `refactor` — Code refactoring
- `test` — Adding or updating tests
- `chore` — Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
